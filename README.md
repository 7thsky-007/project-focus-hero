# Focus Hero â€“ AI Study & Play Balance App  

Final project for the Building AI course  

## Summary  

Focus Hero is an AI-powered app that helps kids balance study time, playtime, and screen entertainment. It provides personalized reminders, fun challenges, and dashboards for both children and parents.  
(Building AI course project)  

## Background  

Kids today spend too much time on screens, which affects their mental health, focus, and social skills. Parents struggle to manage and monitor this.  

Problems solved:  
* Excessive screen time  
* Lack of study-play balance  
* Parents unable to track digital activity  

Motivation: I wanted to build a positive AI tool that helps children develop healthy digital habits while making life easier for parents.  

## How is it used?  

Children get **gamified reminders** and earn rewards for maintaining balance. Parents get **dashboards** showing daily/weekly insights.  

- Child Dashboard (shows balance between study, play, entertainment)  
- Parent Dashboard (summarizes screen usage)  

### Child Dashboard Example

## Data sources and AI methods  

* Data: Screen activity logs, study/playtime entries, parental inputs.  
* AI methods:  
  - Recommendation system for reminders & rewards  
  - Pattern recognition for screen usage  
  - Predictive modeling to suggest balance improvements  

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Data        | Collected from usage patterns |
| AI methods  | ML algorithms for personalization |

## Challenges  

* Cannot replace parental guidance  
* Privacy and data safety must be ensured  
* AI may need localization for different cultures/lifestyles  

## What next?  

* Build a prototype app with working dashboards  
* Integrate with devices (phones, tablets, PCs)  
* Collaborate with educators and psychologists for child-friendly design  
* Expand to include **mental wellness check-ins**
